# Deep-Learning
This project uses a CNN-based deep learning model to detect dental caries (cavities) from images. Built with Python and MySQL, it automates image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification to improve early diagnosis, reduce manual effort, and enhance dental care accuracy.
